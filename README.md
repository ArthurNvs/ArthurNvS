### Hey there, stranger!

I'am Arthur Neves, a **professional software developer** that really loves clean code, clean architecure, TDD and all best practices. 

Always prioritizing effective codes, I'm at the market since 2019, doing my best to find creative and simple solutions for any complex problems.
Today acting as a backend developer in a huge international project at one of our company biggest clients - an American mass media corporation.

**I'm strongly moving towards my dream of becoming a native iOS developer, learning the best practices, the most used frameworks and how to create a good UX and UI based on Apple's guidelines.**
