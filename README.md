### Arthur Neves Monteiro (Games)

Hello! As you can see I'm a **professional software developer** that really appreciate good coding practices.

I've been officially in the industry from 2019 to 2024, always doing my best to find creative and simple solutions.
I worked in the industry as a Java backend developer in very dynamic and complex projects at British Telecom, iHeartMedia and some other brazilian companies.

I'll be now coding on my own, **following the path of game development.** And I believe that one day I'll be able to help people through art, knowledge, and technology.
