### Arthur Neves - Backend / Mobile iOS

Hello! As you can see I'm a **professional software developer** that really loves clean code, clean architecure, TDD and all coding best practices. 

Always seeking an effective code, I'm at the market since 2019, doing my best to find creative and simple solutions for any complex problems.
Today acting as Java backend developer in a very dynamic and complex international project at one of CI&T's biggest clients - an American mass media corporation.

**I'm also a starter native iOS developer, learning the best practices, the most used frameworks and how to create a good UX and UI based on Apple's guidelines.**
Working hard on my personal project - an iPhone App - that I want to launch in the App Store.
