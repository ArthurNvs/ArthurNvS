### Arthur Neves Monteiro

Hello! As you can see I'm an **ex professional software developer** that really appreciate good coding practices.

I've been officially in the industry from 2019 to 2024, always doing my best to find creative and simple solutions for any complex problems.
My last developer job was as a Java backend developer in a very dynamic and complex project at British Telecom, but I also worked at iHeartMedia and other brazilian companies.

**I'm now on the path of game development.** And I believe that one day I'll be able to help people through art, knowledge, and technology.
